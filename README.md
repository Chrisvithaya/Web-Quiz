# Web-Quiz

In the challenge we were tasked to create a web quiz.

I used a bare bone HTML template to get the webpage started and focused primarily on the script.js

Sarting off, I created several variables for the to have the .js respond to the HTML aswell as use buttons and a timer. I decided to give the player 60 seconds.

Moving along, I coded several functions so the variables can work, then chose HTML questions and answers of my liking for the 5 questions. Each questions are worth 20 points.

Finally, I added a loop for the final page for the high scores.
